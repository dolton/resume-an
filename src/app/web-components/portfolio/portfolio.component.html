                        <p>While working in SwiftKanban and SwiftEase, there was a need to scale the application to
                            handle higher load. To test the performance, I built two scripts using JMeter, the first
                            one to test all the available web services and the second one for testing the
                            performance of the basic operations of the application using a number of concurrent
                            users who randomly performed the operations for a certain duration, normally one hour.
                            The reports generated were then analysed and database was tuned accordingly. Also the
                            code was improved and caching and queueing was implemented for reducing the database
                            queries.</p>

                        <p>During working on building the performance scripts and improving the application
                            performance, there was a need for a stable set of environment to get consistent results
                            and improve. To achieve this, I wrote a script using a tool called Vagrant, which
                            created virtual machines. Using the tool, the scripts were developed to create entire
                            infrastructure on AWS using the ec2 containers. The machines were configured using shell
                            scripting, which finally create a web infrastructure consisting of a loadbalancer, web
                            servers, database server, search/ push server, jmeter slave machines and jmeter master
                            machine. The entire infrastructure could be started and terminated on a single command
                            to reduce the cost.</p>
